I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed.

Clearly, i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination. later, the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights. chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop, proof that the flights were booked under my name. however, the date of births used to book the flights were not mine. Clearly, i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to. \\nThe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes, i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes. \\nI am over that but this complaint i am filing is NOT about the original claim.Please read below about this complaint. \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY! \\n\\nAfter this incident, i contacted XXXX and inquired about the flight.

I contacted my bank to inquire about the addituonal fee being charged To my surprise I am being charged an exchange rate fee. To clarify, whenever I use an ATM in a foreign country I will be charged this fee. Additionally if I make a purchase using my ATM card I get charged for conversion to US dollars. In otherwords, I cannot use my ATM card in a foreign country unless I pay whatever additional exchange rate fee they want to charge my account, plus a fee for conversion from foreign money to US dollars (conversion is automatically done by the computer), if I make a purchase and use my card for payment. Regardless if it was paid as a debit or a credit card.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I am a Chase customer since XXXX. I own 2 chase credit cards and I use the checking account to deposit my paychecks every two weeks since past 1 year now. I recently experienced major inconvenience from the Credit Card Fraud department and the Credit Card Dispute Department. \\n\\nBriefly summarizing my case, I booked a flight ticket on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1400.00} from my Chase Freedom Unlimited card..I was about to check-in for the flight on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX to XXXX XXXX, when I get to know that the ticket was no longer valid as the transaction was cancelled by the bank. \\n\\nI went to my nearest Chase bank and the banker named XXXX XXXX tried helping me out with the problem by making a few calls. After being on the call for about 3 hours, we get to learn that someone from the fraud department marked the transaction as fraud and it was then cancelled. Firstly, I never reported the transaction as fraud and I didn't receive any message/call/notification about this from the bank, asking me whether I made the transaction or not. Secondly, I didn't even receive any refund back for 2 months until I called and asked them about it. There was no way for me to know about this incident, except the day before boarding the flight. I had no other option than to book another flight which of course was at a much higher price of {$2200.00}. \\n\\nSo, after 3 months since I first booked the ticket and many long hours of back and forth calls between the 2 departments, I finally did get the {$1400.00} back as a refund, which I appreciate. But I really feel that none of this was my mistake as a transaction was cancelled without even my consent or letting me know in advance. So why should I be bearing a loss of {$800.00}? I don't think it's right to just cancel transactions from a card by marking them fraud without first talking to the customer about it. \\n\\nI e-mailed the same to the CEO, Mr. XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX and received a call back from his department. After reviewing my case and going through the details, I was refused any compensation saying that the bank has the right to cancel any transaction they want, whenever they want. This makes me feel less reliable on Chase credit cards now and I feel it's not the right way to treat the customers. I already cancelled one of the card and stopped depositing my paychecks. Thanks to this unsatisfactory experience. I think more people should hear about my story and be more cautious before using Chase Cards for important transactions.</td>\n",

       "32   My chase amazon card was declined for a catering order I had placed for my brothers funeral in the amount of {$710.00}. I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "45   I made a purchase with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$38.00}. I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

My account has since been closed and I'm out of almost {$2000.00}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "88   I pre-ordered an item on XX/XX/XXXX and paid {$350.00} with a Chase credit card. The merchant, XXXX XXXX, gave an estimated product shipment date of \" XX/XX/XXXX. '' After waiting for this item for a significant amount of time, I decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund from the merchant, XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant stated that my order was cancelled, and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days. The original method of payment was a Chase credit card that I had since closed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a secure message to Chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open Chase cards. I also followed up with a phone call that same week, and the representative I spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase indicating that my \" disputed charge '' would remain on my account and \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account. '' I followed up with a phone call to Chase describing that this was a refund, not a dispute. The representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts. I explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds. They informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund I am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails I received from the merchant about the refund ( see Attachment ).  On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase with similar language about \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account '' and \" we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research '' ( see Attachment ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with the merchant, XXXX XXXX, requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded ( see Attachment ).

       "129  This complaint is a follow up regarding a complaint # XXXX filed on cfpb. \\n\\nThe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below. \\n\\nMy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination. I immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notification.i filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card. chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund. \\nChase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation. when i asked, i was told that i benefited from the transactions. Clearly, i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination. later, the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights. chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop, proof that the flights were booked under my name. however, the date of births used to book the flights were not mine. Clearly, i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to. \\nThe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes, i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes. \\nI am over that but this complaint i am filing is NOT about the original claim.Please read below about this complaint. \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY! \\n\\nAfter this incident, i contacted XXXX and inquired about the flight. They told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund. Chase has NOT contacted XXXX ONCE to resolve this issue. XXXX has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account. However, chase hasnt issued me a refund. Whenever i contact chase, they give me same old response. the case has been closed. I am not opening the same claim. Its a new complaint. XXXX has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase. XXXX 's customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and details.This is chase banks job! connect with them and find out whats going on. Instead chase is asking me to contact XXXX and prove that the refund has been issued. XXXX is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issues.Now, i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted. \\nI am attaching the documents that XXXX has provided me. Chase has asked me to provide these documents. Its chase 's job but i am doing this ob their behalf. \\n\\nXXXX is clearly stating that the bank has the funds. They have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account. \\n\\nPlease issue me a refund. I have done everything i could have. Please, DO NOT close my complaint without issuing me a refund that XXXX has issued a long time ago! \\nEnough is enough!   \n",
       "138  On XX/XX/2019, I submitted a complaint to my bank JP Morgan Chase due to a charge of {$410.00} from my debit card which was lost and the bank did not cancel in time. On said date I disputed the charge and asked to issue a new card. The venue which the card was charged was a strip club called XXXX XXXX based in XXXX, WA. The bank credited my account for the sum but on XX/XX/2019 withdrew those funds and gave them to the club in which I never have been. I submitted a fraud dispute with the bank at the time and today XX/XX/2019 found out that the bank Chase debited my account to the venue in which the fraud dispute was made. I tried to call the bank twice to discuss and was issued a new debit card as well but the charge stayed. \\n\\nIn my dispute and complaint is the bank is committing fraud on my account by siding with said merchant in which is a strip club and known for fraud activity on cards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "160  On more than one occasion my bank ( Chase ) has charged me multiple overdraft fees towards my account. And it has to do with the way they process charges as they hit my account. They will take the largest item first, which will overdraw my account, and then charge smaller items afterwards. Back on XX/XX/XXXX, this very same thing happened. We had a balance of {$130.00} and I had 3 charges come in to my accountone for {$350.00}, one for {$69.00} and another for {$46.00}. The bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me 3 overdraft fees in the amount of {$34.00} each. When I called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger items are more important items like house payments, car payments, etc. The bank has reimbursed us before for this practice, but told me this is a one-time courtesy and will not do it again. \\nHad those charges been done in reverse order, we would have had only one charge. In my opinion, as well as the rep from your agency, this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday!! \\nAnd this continues to happen to this day                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

They only waived {$12.00} out of the total of {$170.00} in overdraft and other fees charged to my checking account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",
       "215  On XXXX/XXXX/2019, my Chase Sapphire Credit Card received a charge in the amount of {$360.00} from XXXX, which I did not authorize. On XXXX/XXXX/2019, I immediately opened a dispute in the local Chase branch. At that time, Chase gave me a temporary credit for the charge. A few days later I canceled the card to refrain from my credit card being charged again fraudulently. However, on XXXX/XXXX/19, the unauthorized charge reappeared on my card again. In addition, on XXXX/XXXX/2019, I received a letter from Chase ( written XXXX/XXXX/2019 ) advising that they received verification of the charge. Yet, it was a fraudulent charge that I did not authorize. Therefore, it is impossible for their verification to be accurate, and I should not be held responsible for the charge. Chase has closed the dispute and rebilled the charge amount of {$360.00} to my card plus interest. I am not happy with the way this matter has been handled. As a result, I do not appreciate the security measures that Chase offers in protecting my account from unauthorized usage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "244  Good evening, On XX/XX/2019 I purchased a XXXX XXXX ticket using Chase Ultimate Rewards Points with my Chase Sapphire Reserve Credit card. XXXX XXXX canceled my return flight and issued me a partial refund for {$150.00}. XXXX informed me on XX/XX/2019 that the refund was processed. It's been weeks and Chase refuse to refund my account. \\nI waited the appropriate amount of time for the refund to appear on my account but it never did. I contacted Chase Card services using the secure messages feature and informed them of the issue. Chase told me the refund processed to a different credit card number from the one I have, and that I'd need to work out my refund with the airline. I contacted XXXX again, who informed me that when a customer books a flight with credit card points, the credit card company itself reserves the flight through a partnered travel agency, and that XXXX had reimbursed Chase 's partnered travel agency, because XXXX can only reimburse in the exact method in which the flight was reserved. \\nA XXXX representative told me to contact Chase again and tell the credit card company to reach out to their agency, confirm the {$150.00} reimbursement, and then forward the refund to my account. I messaged Chase on XX/XX/2019 and told them this issue and asked them to confirm my refund with their agency. Chase sent me a repeat semi-automated response to contact XXXX again, and claimed that I hadn't booked the flight using Chase ( even though I definitely booked the flight with Chase Ultimate Rewards Points and I have the email confirmation to prove it ). Chase customer service is sending me in circles, refusing to follow up with their own travel agency, refusing to read the messages I sent them with pertinent information, and refusing to process my refund to my account. I have spent over twenty hours contacting Chase and two months of frustration waiting for my refund. \\nFurthermore, when I spoke to a Chase representative on the phone on XX/XX/XXXX she was less than helpful. She told me XXXX cancelled my return flight because I'd failed to arrive at the airport for my departing flight ( this was false and easily disproved. I'd flown on the departing flight the day before ). She was also unable to receive emails, so I couldn't show her the XXXX flight or refund information. When I learned I could not forward documents to Chase employees while on the phone, I decided to use the secure messaging. But this method of communicating with Chase has proven just as ineffective. \\nI am attaching to this complaint all of my messages with Chase, proof that XXXX processed my refund, and proof that I purchased the flight through Chase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "263  XXXX, XXXX and XXXX 2019. I have recently used my ATM card make withdrawals in a foreign country. I accept the fee charges from the foreign country banking institution, and an additional $XXXX fee from my bank. I noticed in the months mentioned I being charged an additional $XXXX  or $XXXX service fee. I contacted my bank to inquire about the addituonal fee being charged To my surprise I am being charged an exchange rate fee. To clarify, whenever I use an ATM in a foreign country I will be charged this fee. Additionally if I make a purchase using my ATM card I get charged for conversion to US dollars. In otherwords, I cannot use my ATM card in a foreign country unless I pay whatever additional exchange rate fee they want to charge my account, plus a fee for conversion from foreign money to US dollars (conversion is automatically done by the computer), if I make a purchase and use my card for payment. Regardless if it was paid as a debit or a credit card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "264  Over a year ago I paid a year in advance for a web site hosting plan. After a few months and not completing the proposed project I took the lose and moved on. Then, out of the clear this hosting service tried to bill me for another year, in advance, for their service which I did not need. I contacted this company several times explaining that I no longer need or wanted their services, to no avail, as they never responded to my emails. Finally I called the company and the man I spoke with apologized and said he would clear their error. Shortly after this I noticed that this company charged my account. I called the bank, Chase, and explained what had occurred. They returned the funds to my account. Then last month the bank paid this hosting company again. Enough is enough! It appears that their customer service personal, located in 'never never land '', need better supervision. So, here I am again dealing with more foreign incompetent personal.Yikes!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "307  During the month of XXXX 2019, I lost my credit card and fraudulent charges were on my account for my Chase Amazon Visa ending in XXXX adding up to {$4000.00}. I contacted Chase Amazon Visa and notified them of the charges. There was a fraud case started and they applied a temporary credit to my account. In XX/XX/2019 they reversed the charges back to me. I contacted Chase and was told that they had multiple evidence that the charges were made by myself. Since I knew that was FALSE I asked them to provide me the so-called evidence. I was provided with screenshots of the orders going through which only shows the purchase and email, address, and phone number which, is NOT enough evidence in today 's technology world. The email on the order is not my email, the phone number is not my phone number or any other connection to myself. I made a police report within the city I reside in and I provided Chase Amazon Visa the police report and I asked them to re-open the case since they had false information of the order being placed by myself. I was provided a letter after and said they found no evidence of fraudulent charges and I would be responsible for the charges. When asking what they are basing their decision on and to provide me in writing of their conclusion, I was told they can not do that. As a consumer, I am entitled to know what I am paying for and why also, why I am responsible for an email and phone number that is not mine. I am contesting their decision and charges placed during XXXX 2019. I would like the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to evaluate this situation and help since my rights have not been exercised from Chase Amazon Visa ending in XXXX. \\n\\nThank you, XXXX XXXX                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "321  I am a Chase customer since XXXX. I own 2 chase credit cards and I use the checking account to deposit my paychecks every two weeks since past 1 year now. I recently experienced major inconvenience from the Credit Card Fraud department and the Credit Card Dispute Department. \\n\\nBriefly summarizing my case, I booked a flight ticket on XX/XX/XXXX for {$1400.00} from my Chase Freedom Unlimited card..I was about to check-in for the flight on XX/XX/XXXX from XXXX to XXXX XXXX, when I get to know that the ticket was no longer valid as the transaction was cancelled by the bank. \\n\\nI went to my nearest Chase bank and the banker named XXXX XXXX tried helping me out with the problem by making a few calls. After being on the call for about 3 hours, we get to learn that someone from the fraud department marked the transaction as fraud and it was then cancelled. Firstly, I never reported the transaction as fraud and I didn't receive any message/call/notification about this from the bank, asking me whether I made the transaction or not. Secondly, I didn't even receive any refund back for 2 months until I called and asked them about it. There was no way for me to know about this incident, except the day before boarding the flight. I had no other option than to book another flight which of course was at a much higher price of {$2200.00}. \\n\\nSo, after 3 months since I first booked the ticket and many long hours of back and forth calls between the 2 departments, I finally did get the {$1400.00} back as a refund, which I appreciate. But I really feel that none of this was my mistake as a transaction was cancelled without even my consent or letting me know in advance. So why should I be bearing a loss of {$800.00}? I don't think it's right to just cancel transactions from a card by marking them fraud without first talking to the customer about it. \\n\\nI e-mailed the same to the CEO, Mr. XXXX XXXX, on XX/XX/XXXX and received a call back from his department. After reviewing my case and going through the details, I was refused any compensation saying that the bank has the right to cancel any transaction they want, whenever they want. This makes me feel less reliable on Chase credit cards now and I feel it's not the right way to treat the customers. I already cancelled one of the card and stopped depositing my paychecks. Thanks to this unsatisfactory experience. I think more people should hear about my story and be more cautious before using Chase Cards for important transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "322  This is related to the transactions charged to my account via debit card charges on XX/XX/2019. I had made a few debit card purchases in XXXX using my Chase debit card. On receiving my statement, I see multiple of these transactions and all of these transactions are showing this to be an ATM withdrawal from an ATM address in XXXX with the withdrawal being in XXXX currency ( Rupiah  ). I have never visited XXXX so I could not have withdrawn amount in XXXX currency. Moreover, I have enough evidence to show that I was in XXXX  on and around XX/XX/2019. This seems to be a incorrect or fraudulent transaction caused by Chase Bank or their associate bank operating in XXXX. I am not able to take this up with Chase Bank as they claim that their investigation with the ATM provider shows this to be a valid charge though I have evidence to show that I was in possession of my debit card and present in XXXX  at that time.\\n\\nFurther to this, the account has been forcibly closed without my consent with the reason provided as too many transaction where I have clearly mentioned that these transactions are unauthorized.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "334  I purchased a Refrigerator on a store Credit Card. I mistakenly decided that I would use my ability to use cash advance to pay off another credit card to transfer the store card balance to my Chase MC that offered no interest for 12 months. I payed the XXXX \" process '' fee. I should have had a red flag then. I have paid on my balance for 6 months now and have no discernable difference in the balance of the transferred to 0 percent APR balance. I called them about this and I have NEVER had such a go around the bush explanation for why this is happening. Once XXXX get 's here I'll be paying major interest on this purchase, more than if I had left it on the store card. This is a sham of a way to get you in a spiral upward issue with interest on one 's Credit Card. \\n\\nI am at this point just going to pay all but XXXX of the balance and be done with this completely by XXXX and not use the Chase card again, even for my Amazon XXXX unless I can pay off within the month. I certainly will NEVER use a convenience check/cash advance on this card. \\n\\nThis type of usury should be outlawed, or the CFPB do something about.

They then told me a woman I was speaking to at the bar was an entertainer and I owed XXXX euros for her service, none of which was agreed to. Initially the charge came through as fraud and declined but when none of my cards were going through due to fraud a man took my passport and wallet and phone and threatened me with physical violence. If I didnt pay I would get hurt. They forged my signature. Chase initially reported it as fraud and gave me a new card then changed it to a dispute and denied the claim.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",
       "475  In XX/XX/2019, a computer was purchased from amazon. The item was defective and returned 12 days after in XX/XX/2019 via XXXX with tracking number XXXX. The item was initially refunded and all was well. XX/XX/2019, the credit card was charged again for this item and that is when everything went downhill with chase. Someone had opened a dispute with them and they stated we had to submit tracking information for the return of this item. When there was no response they closed it in favor of the seller. We had no idea that there was even a dispute. The letter received was online and because we did not know there was a dispute, because neither of us recall contacting chase, we did not look at the online letters. If that was the case, we would have promptly provided the documentation needed to be refunded. After talking with amazon and chase for over a month because somehow, a dispute was reopened. Tracking information was provided again and on XX/XX/XXXX, we received another letter from chase stating the charge was valid. After speaking with XXXX with chase disputes in XXXX XXXX Texas, he stated that the charge was valid and deemed valid because the tracking information was not provided in the initial time frame on the initial dispute. Basically, after reopening the the dispute, the tracking information provided on the second time disputed was not looked at and that the only way that we can dispute this again is to write a written letter disputing it and why we are disputing it. This is for over 1000 dollars and tracking information as well as documentation from amazon and the seller provides proof that the charge is not valid. We were not asked to provide any other information this time other than tracking so if the tracking was not going to be enough, I should have been told this one of the 23 times I called about this dispute. This is an illegal practice and there is no legal way that this charge is even valid. Their process for determining that this is a legal charge is not right and should be corrected along with all the time and money Ive spent disputing this charge. The seller stated that the item was returned and that they refunded a smaller portion due to signs of use and the item was working which is not fair either because the item did not work. Regardless I dont have the item!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "505  On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased a bike on my chase visa debit card online for in store pickup at XXXX XXXX goods. I paid {$220.00} and a hold was placed on my card for this amount and the charge would formally go through when the bike was picked up. I was unable to pick the bike up within 48 hours so the order was canceled. The hold was removed and I was never charged for the purchase. On XX/XX/XXXX I purchased the same bike at the same XXXX XXXX goods online for in store pickup on the same card. This time I paid {$230.00}. Again a hold was placed on the card. My husband went to pick the bike up that evening and the girl checking him out saw on the account we had previously purchased that bike but our order had been canceled. She offered to price match and give my husband the lower price for the bike. She assured him he would not be charged twice. On XX/XX/XXXX I checked our statement and realized we had been charged twice. I contacted XXXX multiple times who told me they would get back to me. Multiple times they told me it was taken care of and I should see the refund in 3-5 business days. When I never received the refund I contacted Chase. They opened a case and investigated it. They came back with conclusion that this was 2 separate orders and the charges were valid. In the meantime, I received an email from XXXX stating that they determined the first order was never picked up and they had processed a refund in the amount of XXXX to my chase visa debit card. I never received this credit. I contacted chase again and they opened another case. I provided the transaction ID from XXXX for the refund and Chase still came to the conclusion that the charge was valid. I called XXXX again and they again provided me with an email receipt showing the date and amount the refund was processed ( {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX ) and again provided the transaction ID. I faxed this yet again to chase and they are still stating they will have to review the case and contact me. It has now been 2 business days and they stated they would get back to me in one business day. Its also worth noting that on XX/XX/XXXX I went into a Chase branch and tried to get a resolution and the banker took my information and assured me someone from the escalated claims department would contact me in 3-5 business days. No one ever contacted me. Its absurd to me that a bank can keep my money which was refunded to me by the merchant. Also, Chase came to the conclusion that the charge was valid when I provided them with proof from the Merchant that the merchant was admitting the charge was not valid. Im frustrated and want my money back.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "519  On XX/XX/2020, I received notification from Chase to call their Fraud Department to verify a suspicious transaction. \\n\\nAt that time, I spoke with a representative to confirm that I never made a purchase at {$1.00} at XXXX and have never made a purchase on that website in my life. ( I don't even own an XXXX or any other XXXX-branded products. ) He then told me it would be necessary to close out my account ending in XXXX and that a new card would be issued in 7-10 days. The new card ( now ending in XXXX ) arrived within the week. \\n\\nToday, XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter that the fraud investigation has been completed and the original amount has been charged back to my new account ending in XXXX. The stated reason : \" You have received benefit from this transaction. '' What?!?! \\n\\nSo now I am being charged for a transaction which Chase previously flagged as suspicious and then, upon confirmation that I did not make it, subsequently closed my account due to this fraudulent charge - only to charge me for it 3 months later.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",
       "545  I made a call to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX to cancel a trip. Back in mid XXXX ( on or around the XXXX ) I called to complain about a time share stay I had and they had tricked me into believing I was getting a free \" courtesy trip '' for my trouble. \\nAfter scheduling the trip they informed me this was going to be a sales pitch and not at a resort but a stay at a hotel and \" any adult with me had to attend this presentation ''. \\nI called about two weeks later and attempted to cancel this trip with them and was told I was two days too late to do so. \\n\\nI took the next step to call XXXX Chase Card Services to put this in dispute. The CS Representative advised me they would not put it in dispute via verbal complaint and I had to send it to the Executive office in writing with my documentation. I did this on XX/XX/XXXX. The Executive office had me fax it to another location as she stated this was a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX  issue and is handled elsewhere. She also advised it would take at least 30 days to get a response from XXXX. I followed her direction. \\nI waited and after two months called to follow up as I had received nothing in writing. I finally received a confirmation letter in XXXX, Meanwhile Chase billed me several late fees and an Annual Renewal fee in XXXX. There collections dept. began calling saying I was incurring late fees and I needed to pay them. They also stated they had nothing in their system that a dispute was active. At that time I also had no correspondence that my complaint was in dispute status, I did not pay them this fee. I did not trust they would not turn around and put it toward the charges I was disputing and determine the rest had to be paid. I had advised them of this during their and my phone calls. I called the Chase directly and spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX after one of the above calls was received by me. He assured me he would handle it and gave me a case number XXXX I never received a final determination in writing from them and called them about the late fees that were charged to my account. They reversed the during that call on XX/XX/XXXX. They told me I had a XXXX balance for annual fees for XXXX. I paid that via phone and then the Rep told me the card was closed. This month XX/XX/XXXX I received a bill for XXXX. I called them and they said they reversed fees twice in error and this was the balance due. This has been a complete and total run around I have gotten from XXXX Chase Cardservices. I do not recommend them. One of my biggest concerns is that I have great credit and they put this on my credit report as a non payment issue vs disputed charges. In addition to charging a XXXX annual fee for a card they closed, none of this was put in writing as a final decision on their part.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "570  I signed up for a credit Card thru Chase. The card was marketed as 0 % APR with NO fees. I recently traveled abroad and used the card or few purchases. Chase added 5 % transaction fees to the transactions in the latest statement. Upon confronting them about the issue, they are not willing to accept any wrong doing or willing to take off the fees. In addition to that, Chase is not willing to accept that they solicited false claims and marketing claims about the card.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

I reached out to the Customer Claims department and they said they would not investigate any further and I have not heard back from my branch manager.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

'' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer.

       "      <td>I am writing you to file a complaint about an unresolved issue with my credit card chase and their benefit and travel departments. This has been my second travel related credit issue with chase. My first experience with chase was also about a credit that they were supposed to process. Chase was either unresponsive or slow. I finally ended up contacting the airlines directly and got a much quicker response and resolution from them. \\n\\nMy more recent issue with Chase has been my most stressful and frustrating experience when dealing with any credit card company or for that matter any other company that offers products or services. I am a Chase Sapphire card holder who has been using the card regularly for purchases amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars every month. I have an excellent payment history with most of the bills paid in full every month. \\n\\n\\nIn XXXX  of 2019, I bought my XXXX airline ticket for an overseas trip through Chase using my accumulated Chase points. My father passed away overseas a week before my trip. I had to cancel my original trip and leave immediately so I called chase to cancel my ticket. Despite, under a lot of stress and in grief, I had to be on the phone with them for hours. I was put on long holds, transferred to different departments and still did not receive a definitive answer about cancelation of my trip and credit to my account. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the last customer representative that I spoke with that night, they had to send an email to a different department and that I could follow up with them the following week by Tuesday or Wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then. Unfortunately, It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours. I had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on XX/XX/XXXX, which was our original plan. \\n\\n\\nMy husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments. He spoke with the main customer service, the benefits and the chase travel. Initially, a representative advised him to contact XXXX  directly to cancel my ticket. Finally, after further research, the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family, The representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that Chase would get the refund from XXXX on our behalf. According to him, all we needed was a death certificate. Since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks, the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the Chase received the death certificate from us. \\n\\nIn XXXX, while still overseas, I received an e-mail on XXXX, XXXX from XXXX in Chase travel who was following up with the death certificate. I e-mailed Chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me. I even e-mailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by Chase or XXXX. I sent it to XXXX who had contacted me on XXXX, XXXX by responding to her e-mail from XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it. For personal and family reasons, I ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the United States on XXXX. There was still no acknowledgment from XXXX or anyone from Chase Travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my e-mail from XXXX or any other update. Soon after my return, I had to send the travel department my father 's death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call. I also tried to send them an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX, expressing my disappointment and requesting an update. I also tried to correspond with Chase customer service and Chase travel through my online chase account. \\n\\nChase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an e-mail that they had received and located the death certificate that I had sent them. The e-mail was from XXXX, one of the Travel consultant supervisor for chase travel. According to her, they had forwarded the death certificate to XXXX. She apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation. During this whole ordeal with Chase, I had contacted XXXX numerous times and spoke to different representatives. According to XXXX, In order for Chase to process my credit, they didn't need to forward the death certificate to XXXX. \\n\\nIn one of my initials calls to Chase after my return to the United States, I found out that the case number / reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in XXXX could not be used as a reference because I was told that it did not exist in their system. In XXXX and XXXX, I spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue. Customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and I ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight. \\n\\nThere was one supervisor in Chase travel department, which was probably being managed by XXXX, named XXXX, whom I ended up speaking with twice. During our brief conversation, She flatly refused to help me or answer any questions. She had the most condescending attitude that I have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company. She refused to give me an update or call XXXX. She refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me. To top it all, she told me I needed a proof that I was related to the deceased which was contrary to what I had been told up till that point that all I needed was a death certificate. I called XXXX and according to them, a proof of relationship was not necessary or required. XXXX told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and Chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I emailed and I called Chase few times and each time I was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened. One of the last representatives that that I spoke with was on XXXX, XXXX, who was from Chase benefits department. To my utter shock and surprise, he told me that they didn't have any type of claim for me on file. I was beyond hope at that point. He then transferred me once again to their travel department. The representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from XXXX. I requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before I could speak with one. She promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always, I never heard from anyone. \\n\\nAfter several weeks on the phone with Chase and after speaking to XXXX multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from Chase, I finally decided that I would wait and see if the issue would be resolved. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that I would receive a phone call. \\n\\nI have finally decided that I am going to file a formal complaint with every private, state and federal consumer protection agency or organization. I would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me. I have been a great customer. I may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with Chase or its representatives. I have been managing my credit responsibly over the years, had several premium credit card offers as I had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as Chase Sapphire. I decided to go with Chase and was hopeful that I would take advantage of their travel benefits. I spent thousands of dollars using my Chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits. \\n\\nAs stated earlier, I fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills. Chase on the other hand, failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise. A timely credit, under the circumstances, was my right. It was according to and within the rules set by both the Chase and XXXX Airlines. Unfortunately, I was never able to utilize the points that I had accumulated. A credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect, follow their own rules, keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules, be its customer 's adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties. I feel that Chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations. It with deep regret that I have to reconsider my business relationship with them. It is a shame that a well known company like Chase offering a premium card such as, Chase Sapphire and charging a $ XXXX yearly membership fee for it, would have such a poor service. It is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers.</td>\n",

They sent 1099 's to a non-existent address- one that has NEVER been used or reported by me or my cosigner. The address they used is a splicing of 2 separate addresses in 2 different cities in the same state. This cancellation was done after Chase claims they made multiple attempts to contact my cosigner for repayment, an arguable fact as my cosigner has absolutely no knowledge or paperwork to that affect though Chase has her correct address and phone number ( I have confirmed this through phone calls with Chase ).\\n\\nMy cosigner is a retired account and as such, she keeps every scrap of paper concerning loans and financing she receives and she has no record of the loans Chase reported cancelled-nor do I- so I contacted Chase to request copies of the original loan contracts as proof that the loans are in fact mine. These loans do not show up on either of our credit reports so we are questioning where they came from. \\n\\nMy first phone call to Chase was on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a woman named XXXX in the IRS notice department. She was \" unable to provide further information ''. Because Chase no longer directly deals with Student Loans, I could not get a direct number into Chase so I contacted our Local Chase bank branch and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information I was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could. \\n\\nWhen I hadn't heard anything, I reached back out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager, who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through Chase 's complaint and compliance department. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) with the complaint and compliance department. She said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans. When they completed their search, she would be back in touch with what they found. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the Chase Recovery and loan specialist department, who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation I was seeking. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Loan Specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the Loan numbers, amounts and cosigner. I asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans \" drop off as soon as they are cancelled, '' a statement that is absolutely false. I requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue. The contract was post marked XX/XX/XXXX and arrived XX/XX/XXXX. However, the contract she sent was NOT the correct Loan contract. It was not the correct dates, amount or loan number.\\n\\nRealizing that I wasn't getting anywhere, my cosigner contacted Chase on XX/XX/XXXX attempting to get the information i requested. The man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts, referred her to the IRS for further questions. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my Cosigner again contacted Chase to directly request contract copies for these loans. On this phone call, she was told she was NOT a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Chase again and spoke to loan specialist #  XXXX who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans. She said the original loans were taken out between XXXX. She said loans were charged off XX/XX/XXXX, letters sent in XXXX and reported cancelled in XXXX. This time she Could NOT confirm the address the 1099 's were sent to. She said she had no idea where the address came from ; she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports ( she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to \" fix '' the non reported loans ; I declined ). She said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the 1099 's for these loans, to be sent to me in 7-10 business days. Unfortunately the only documentation she sent were 1099 's with the wrong address. I have STILL yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts.\\n\\nIt has been 2 months, numerous phones calls, and misinformation and I can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility. I once again called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans. I was transferred to a voicemail, left a very specific message with appropriate contact information, and I have yet to receive a phone call back as of XX/XX/XXXX, even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within 24 business hours.</td>\n",

However, I had to make a complete payment, pay late fees, and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history. \\n\\nXXXX was negligent with the files transfer and XXXX was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered. \\n\\nWhat can be done? I have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me. No one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances. I thought that I am entitled to all records about myself. \\n\\nI am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run. XXXX must have been really evil and XXXX doesn't really read what they are given or even contact the person. XXXX did not let me know they were changing services. \\n\\nI can provide only the mortgage verification from Chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data. They say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed. Evidently, XXXX did not use a human review process to read, only accept checked fields of bad records.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I received an offer from Chase XXXX Visa promising a companion airline pass XXXX bonus points for opening a Chase XXXX Visa card. I applied for the card online in XX/XX/XXXX providing my current email address, phone number and address. I was approved. In XXXX I requested paperless billing statements/correspondence and assumed that my current contact information provided at time of approval would be utilized by Chase for the XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nHaving previous Chase credit card products I was able to log into my online account and setup automatic bill payment for my account. I used my card as needed to earn the companion pass and bonus points and assumed the auto payments were being made from my checking account as I viewed line items that had Chase in the description and as I was not receiving paper statements/emails or phone calls from Chase regarding my XXXX account. \\n\\nIn reviewing my checking account statement in XXXX and realizing the that the Chase line item was actually an auto payment for one of my husbands credit cards and was not in fact for the XXXX Visa card I reached out to Chase XXXX Visa immediately. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the customer service phone number listed on the back of my card ( Payments are due on the XXXX of the month ) to learn that I was 34 days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take 1-2 business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect. \\n\\nAdditionally, I learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information I had provided at the time of application. \\n\\nI made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance, requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future. \\n\\nThey made notation in the account of the challenge, reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late payment would not be reported to the credit bureau due to the banking error. Also confirmed that I had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error, reversal of late charges, payment in full and notation that I would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which I HAVE received. This reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end. \\n\\nAll subsequent payments have been made on time and as of XX/XX/XXXX the account has a {$12.00} balance due to charges made after payment in full. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX alert service that I subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from XXXX to XXXX. I opened the XXXX file which stated a late payment was reported by Chase for XXXX. I filed a dispute and in XXXX received an email from XXXX  stating the dispute had been resolved. Upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed. \\n\\nI contacted Chase XXXX Visa, explained the negative reporting, the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges. They stated that the \" Credit Bureau Unit '' was not currently open and requested I call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information. \\n\\nI followed the advice and spoke with XXXX, CBU specialist in the XXXX, MO call center. After a long period of discussion XXXX informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau. \\n\\nAfter requesting all notation on my file he advised I send a fax to the \" Business Office '' at ( XXXX ) XXXX but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that I could send the request to. \\n\\nI asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to XXXX customer service. \\n\\nIn speaking with XXXX in customer service I believed that I was still speaking to the Credit Bureau department. I recalled all events, she confirmed the notation in the account. Additionally, I advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on XX/XX/XXXX my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all Chase accounts. I was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account I received a screen that stated that I needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbers/email that were pre-populated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information. I had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once I was able to gain access into the account I confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the DEFAULT contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information. \\n\\nI explained to her that when I tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account. She assisted with updating on her end, had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information. \\n\\nGiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup I asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting. At this point SHE ADVISED ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE CREDIT BUREAU DEPARTMENT and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done. I explained that I had already spoken with XXXX in that department and that I was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her. She stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to 5 days to provide a call back. \\n\\nShe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named XXXX, explained the situation and XXXX told her that there \" was nothing that he could do to assist ''. \\n\\nI have never been late with a payment across all accounts. I have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with JP Morgan Chase/XXXX. As a result of Chase/XXXX XXXX it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment &amp; provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that I will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from \" Outstanding '' to \" Good '' and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered. \\n\\nI am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to 1 ) Assist with restoring my credit due to banking/IT error on the part of the credit card issuer 2 ) By sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from Chase and have to deal with the same challenges I have faced.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On more than one occasion my bank ( Chase ) has charged me multiple overdraft fees towards my account. And it has to do with the way they process charges as they hit my account. They will take the largest item first, which will overdraw my account, and then charge smaller items afterwards. Back on XX/XX/XXXX, this very same thing happened. We had a balance of {$130.00} and I had 3 charges come in to my accountone for {$350.00}, one for {$69.00} and another for {$46.00}. The bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me 3 overdraft fees in the amount of {$34.00} each. When I called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger items are more important items like house payments, car payments, etc. The bank has reimbursed us before for this practice, but told me this is a one-time courtesy and will not do it again. \\nHad those charges been done in reverse order, we would have had only one charge. In my opinion, as well as the rep from your agency, this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday!! \\nAnd this continues to happen to this day</td>\n",

       "1    Good morning my name is XXXX XXXX and I appreciate it if you could help me put a stop to Chase Bank cardmember services. \\nIn 2018 I wrote to Chase asking for debt verification and what they sent me a statement which is not acceptable. I am asking the bank to validate the debt. Instead I been receiving mail every month from them attempting to collect a debt. \\nI have a right to know this information as a consumer. \\n\\nChase account # XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Thanks in advance

       "59   I currently have over XXXX Chase Ultimate Rewards points, which are worth at least {$7500.00}. \\n\\nAround XX/XX/2018 ( 4 months ago ), when I tried to access my Chase Ultimate Rewards account ( or even activate the 5 % bonus on Chase Freedom ), I would get shown this page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' ( image attached as well ) : XXXX : XXXX At first I thought it was just a temporary error ( which isn't uncommon for Chase ), but after 2 weeks this was still happening, so I called customer support. They opened a ticket, got escalated to their tech team, but when I would call back to find out what happened, they told me that the case had been closed. This happened 3 times, and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information. \\n\\nGoing from ultimaterewards.com and chase.com have the  same result. \\n\\nI'm not able to use these points by phone either, because the operators for the Travel Center are not able to access my account/points neither. \\n\\nI've tried every browser, both XXXX and XXXX computers, and the XXXX Chase phone application. They all send me to the page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up some people that work in Ultimate Rewards on XXXX, and cold called a VP of Customer Relations. He acted like he was helpful at first, and we exchanged some emails. He eventually said I can buy a flight/hotel using Chase Sapphire and if I give him the details, he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase. \\n\\nLong story short, he wasn't able to fix anything. \\n\\nI can see that I'm still collecting points, but I haven't been able to access it. \\n\\nI travel a lot, and it's become a huge inconvenience that I'm not able to access these points which I intended to use for travel. I need to get this issue resolved ASAP.

       "93   On XX/XX/2019 we purchased a service with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ( also known as XXXX   XXXX XXXX XXXX by XXXX XXXX ) for our group of 23 people to go to various islands and snorkeling activities out of XXXX. The bases of the dispute is that XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX took us to 1 island only and did not follow thru with the itinerary that had been planned out. Most of the conversation was over the phone. At the end of the day with much confusion XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX charged my card {$4400.00} for services NOT rendered. This is the cause of the dispute. I tried dealing with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and they were not budging on refunding us partial payment due to not following the itinerary that had been planned. So I then went to my Credit Card Chase Sapphire Dispute Department to resolve the issue. After many, many phone calls and months of dealing with this dispute, our Credit Card has sided with XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX word over ours on what went on that day. Basically XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX has continuously lied about the events that day and even said they gave us a credit which was also another lie. I have spent so much time on this and can not believe that we as customers with a very good history have to deal with our Credit Card on this level. \\n\\nThere was another large group lead by XXXX XXXX on this excursion who also felt they were not given what was promised. That group also disputed the charges and was refunded the money by their Credit Card company. \\n\\nOn the attached PDF pages 12 -14 give details of what went wrong that day.

       "21   On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.

       "86   A student loan with Chase bank, they sold there accounts to XXXX - which now holds my account. This happened back in 2013. Though I have made numerous attempts to contact them, they do not respond and they tell me know one works in that department any more so there is no one to contact. Because of this, instead of saying sold on my credit report it shows that I am very behind on payments and it is hurting my credit. I have called them and mailed letter, and no response.

       "65   I opened the Chase/XXXX XXXX Rewards credit card. At the time I was verbally told that the offer was XXXX rapid reward points and a companion pass after spending $ XXXX in the first three months. I followed a link provided to open the credit card. Now they are saying that the offer was over at the time and they have given me a much less valuable sign-up promotion that doesn't include the companion pass. The companion pass was the entire reason we signed-up and the reason the card was promoted to me. They have informed me that the offer was from Jan 10-Feb 11 and that my cc shows approval on the XXXX XXXX. The supervisor I spoke to said that they specifically don't send out offer details to confirm your offer when you sign up ( thus denying me evidence ) but also that they can't fix it without this evidence. I feel that their offer and subsequent actions are fraudulent and constitute deceptive practices. When I spoke to XXXX, they acknowledged that it doesn't seem right but stated that Chase is the one who has to authorize the deals so the error was definitely on their end.

       "64   Chase is marketing credit cards to those of us with good credit like it's going out of style. Be careful - the marketing is not clear. IF you already have a SWA Chase personal card, do not apply for the new one online. This has sent me through a XXXX triangle, wasting my time and therefore money. \\n\\nIt appears in the middle of XX/XX/2018, Chase expanded their undisclosed 5/24 rule to include ALL co-branded cards, not just SWA, yet the marketing machine continues to ignore this policy and the Agents on the phone are not well trained. I am contacting the credit bureau b/c two of the cards opened are not mine - that is the silver lining here. \\n\\nHowever, the issue with incessant marketing of their branded cards to customers, plus this confusing 5/24 rule and lack of Agent phone training, is false advertising. The information is still relatively opaque, as Chase never comments on the 5/24 rule, but multiple reader and community data points suggest denials due to 5/24 for cards previously exempt. \\n\\nCFPB staff, please help educate consumers and hold the big banks accountable for deceptive trade practices. I do not believe this is intentional on Chase 's part, but the second to last Agent did encourage me to file a complaint here, so be it. \\n\\nThank you! \\n\\nXXXX

       "11   On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.

       "94   I am writing you to file a complaint about an unresolved issue with my credit card chase and their benefit and travel departments. This has been my second travel related credit issue with chase. My first experience with chase was also about a credit that they were supposed to process. Chase was either unresponsive or slow. I finally ended up contacting the airlines directly and got a much quicker response and resolution from them. \\n\\nMy more recent issue with Chase has been my most stressful and frustrating experience when dealing with any credit card company or for that matter any other company that offers products or services. I am a Chase Sapphire card holder who has been using the card regularly for purchases amounting to hundreds or thousands of dollars every month. I have an excellent payment history with most of the bills paid in full every month. \\n\\n\\nIn XXXX  of 2019, I bought my XXXX airline ticket for an overseas trip through Chase using my accumulated Chase points. My father passed away overseas a week before my trip. I had to cancel my original trip and leave immediately so I called chase to cancel my ticket. Despite, under a lot of stress and in grief, I had to be on the phone with them for hours. I was put on long holds, transferred to different departments and still did not receive a definitive answer about cancelation of my trip and credit to my account. \\n\\n\\nAccording to the last customer representative that I spoke with that night, they had to send an email to a different department and that I could follow up with them the following week by Tuesday or Wednesday as they would have processed my cancelation by then. Unfortunately, It is extremely difficult, if not impossible, to be calling from overseas and be on the phone with the credit card company for hours. I had to authorize my husband to follow up on my behalf the following week before his upcoming trip overseas as he had to leave on XX/XX/XXXX, which was our original plan. \\n\\n\\nMy husband called them few times and went through the same process of being on the phone for hours either being on hold or being transferred to different departments. He spoke with the main customer service, the benefits and the chase travel. Initially, a representative advised him to contact XXXX  directly to cancel my ticket. Finally, after further research, the same representative that he spoke to in the benefit department told him that we should expect to receive a credit because of the death in the family, The representative assigned us a case number and told my husband that Chase would get the refund from XXXX on our behalf. According to him, all we needed was a death certificate. Since we were both expected to be out of the country for few weeks, the representative told my husband that the credit could be processed anytime upon our return or soon after the Chase received the death certificate from us. \\n\\nIn XXXX, while still overseas, I received an e-mail on XXXX, XXXX from XXXX in Chase travel who was following up with the death certificate. I e-mailed Chase travel department the scanned copy of the death certificate as soon as it became available to me. I even e-mailed them a translation of the death certificate which was neither required by Chase or XXXX. I sent it to XXXX who had contacted me on XXXX, XXXX by responding to her e-mail from XXXX, XXXX and then forwarded it again to her to make sure that they received it. For personal and family reasons, I ended up staying a little longer than expected and retuned to the United States on XXXX. There was still no acknowledgment from XXXX or anyone from Chase Travel or any other department acknowledging the receipt of my e-mail from XXXX or any other update. Soon after my return, I had to send the travel department my father 's death certificate for the third time and even tried to follow up with a phone call. I also tried to send them an e-mail on XX/XX/XXXX, expressing my disappointment and requesting an update. I also tried to correspond with Chase customer service and Chase travel through my online chase account. \\n\\nChase travel finally responded with an acknowledgement through an e-mail that they had received and located the death certificate that I had sent them. The e-mail was from XXXX, one of the Travel consultant supervisor for chase travel. According to her, they had forwarded the death certificate to XXXX. She apologized for my experience with them and also asked me to disregard any other emails from them requesting documentation. During this whole ordeal with Chase, I had contacted XXXX numerous times and spoke to different representatives. According to XXXX, In order for Chase to process my credit, they didn't need to forward the death certificate to XXXX. \\n\\nIn one of my initials calls to Chase after my return to the United States, I found out that the case number / reference number assigned to us and given to my husband by the by chase benefits department in XXXX could not be used as a reference because I was told that it did not exist in their system. In XXXX and XXXX, I spoke to several people and few supervisors hoping that they could resolve my issue. Customer service agents who seemed willing to help did not have the authority to resolve my issue as there was no outcome and I ended up wasting several hours without any resolution in sight. \\n\\nThere was one supervisor in Chase travel department, which was probably being managed by XXXX, named XXXX, whom I ended up speaking with twice. During our brief conversation, She flatly refused to help me or answer any questions. She had the most condescending attitude that I have ever experienced from an agent affiliated with any company. She refused to give me an update or call XXXX. She refused to transfer me to her manager or anyone that could assist me. To top it all, she told me I needed a proof that I was related to the deceased which was contrary to what I had been told up till that point that all I needed was a death certificate. I called XXXX and according to them, a proof of relationship was not necessary or required. XXXX told me that it was their policy that all that was needed was a death certificate and Chase should have processed my credit as soon as they received it. \\n\\nIn XXXX, I emailed and I called Chase few times and each time I was promised that a supervisor would get back to me which never happened. One of the last representatives that that I spoke with was on XXXX, XXXX, who was from Chase benefits department. To my utter shock and surprise, he told me that they didn't have any type of claim for me on file. I was beyond hope at that point. He then transferred me once again to their travel department. The representative there told me that they were still waiting to hear from XXXX. I requested to speak with a supervisor and she told me it would be two hours before I could speak with one. She promised that a supervisor would call me back but as always, I never heard from anyone. \\n\\nAfter several weeks on the phone with Chase and after speaking to XXXX multiple times who repeatedly told me that the delay was from Chase, I finally decided that I would wait and see if the issue would be resolved. Today is XX/XX/XXXX and Chase has still not processed my credit and followed up or called back in response to any of my previous phone calls even when they promised that I would receive a phone call. \\n\\nI have finally decided that I am going to file a formal complaint with every private, state and federal consumer protection agency or organization. I would share my experience on any relevant online or offline forums available to me. I have been a great customer. I may have been frustrated with my experience but have always been respectful in my communications with Chase or its representatives. I have been managing my credit responsibly over the years, had several premium credit card offers as I had met their criteria to apply for their cards with similar benefits as Chase Sapphire. I decided to go with Chase and was hopeful that I would take advantage of their travel benefits. I spent thousands of dollars using my Chase card even though some of my other cards also offered attractive benefits. \\n\\nAs stated earlier, I fulfilled my obligation of using credit responsibly and of paying my bills. Chase on the other hand, failed to issue me a credit and fulfill its promise. A timely credit, under the circumstances, was my right. It was according to and within the rules set by both the Chase and XXXX Airlines. Unfortunately, I was never able to utilize the points that I had accumulated. A credit card company at the very least should treat every customer with respect, follow their own rules, keep their promises and follow up with their customers and if required and within the rules, be its customer 's adovocate on his or her behalf when dealing with third parties. I feel that Chase fell short of these basic standards and expectations. It with deep regret that I have to reconsider my business relationship with them. It is a shame that a well known company like Chase offering a premium card such as, Chase Sapphire and charging a $ XXXX yearly membership fee for it, would have such a poor service. It is either a case of extreme mismanagement by chase or a system deliberately designed in such a way that it only benefits the company at the expense of its customers.   \n",

       "26   I have reached out to XXXX several times in attempt to have this fraudulent inquiry removed I was told that I need to call and contact the original creditor that placed this inquiry on my report. I have made several attempts to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that was not authorized by me. They seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempts I have made nobody seems to understand what I'm talkin about. I want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before I take legal action. I I have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them. I have an iquiry from XX/XX/2019. I want this matter resolved.

       "52   My roommate was stealing my Chase debit card and drivers license ; pretending to be me and withdrawing money from my account. He admitted that he figured out my pin because it happens to be the same as my phone password. \\n\\nHe also admitted that he would sneak into my room while I was sleeping and put the card back before I woke up. \\n\\nHe apologized but says he spent the money. I tried to dispute this with Chase but they claim that since my debit card PIN number was used that they cant prove it wasnt me. \\n\\nAlthough they advertise that I have 100 % Fraud Protection they refuse to give me my money back. \\n\\nATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$200.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$280.00} ATM Withdrawl - XX/XX/XXXX - {$240.00} ATM

       "17   With out notice J.P. Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

       "35   I opened the saving account for the {$25.00} bonus. I was supposed to received the {$25.00} bonus after 3 consecutive auto transfers from checking to savings. I notice on XX/XX/2019 that automatic transfer was cancelled for not enough funds into my checking 's account. Therefore, I put enough funds in my account on XX/XX/2019 requested that the executive team reactivate my automatic transfer for the month of XXXX. Although Ms. XXXX reached out to me from the executive office, she failed to try to resolve my concerns ( case # XXXX ).

       "92   In XX/XX/2019, several transactions on my Chase checking account was fraudulent so I filed a report with Chase. Instead of helping me, Chase closed all my accounts and refused to have a banking relationship with me from then on. Then Chase froze all my money for a month and eventually sent me a balance after I had filed a complaint with CFPB. Now a month later, Chase tries to collect {$190.00} in debt that I have no idea where it came from. Chase said the balance was a result of a fraudulent transaction that Chase decided that I was responsible for.

       "27   I opened an account with chase bank on XXXX and used a code for XXXX bonus. I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once I made XXXX direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in 10 days. As of XXXX I had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the 21 days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.

       "43   Chase sent me an email today with the innocuous title \" Important information regarding changes to your Chase account '' ( they often use similar titles for ads and other communications ). \\n\\nIn it, they force me into binding arbitration ( despite that never being something I had agreed to and never being a part of any contract between me and them ). \\n\\nThey do include a method to opt out, but have no additional information about the consequences ( many other people I've seen who have had a similar problem are afraid that Chase will close their account if they opt out ) and, even more egregiously, despite Chase simply sending an email doing this, they require me to mail them a letter with my personal information enclosed in order to opt out. \\n\\nThis is clearly less secure and a massive loss of both my time and money that is clearly being used solely to dissuade people from opting out. \\n\\nThis is blatant malpractice by Chase.

       "99   My name is XXXX XXXX. I have missed a payment in XX/XX/2018 and was 30 days past due but now current. I applied numerous times for a loan modification to get loss mitigation assistance but did not get any help. Chase only gave me a loan forbearance option. I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and have an issue with refinancing since my DTI is too high because of excessive debt so I get declined every time and my credit score is too low at XXXX.

       "203  JP Morgan and Chase reported 3 loans ( $ XXXX, $ XXXX and $ XXXX respectively ) as  cancelled debt, to the IRS on my behalf in XX/XX/XXXX. They sent 1099 's to a non-existent address- one that has NEVER been used or reported by me or my cosigner. The address they used is a splicing of 2 separate addresses in 2 different cities in the same state. This cancellation was done after Chase claims they made multiple attempts to contact my cosigner for repayment, an arguable fact as my cosigner has absolutely no knowledge or paperwork to that affect though Chase has her correct address and phone number ( I have confirmed this through phone calls with Chase ).\\n\\nMy cosigner is a retired account and as such, she keeps every scrap of paper concerning loans and financing she receives and she has no record of the loans Chase reported cancelled-nor do I- so I contacted Chase to request copies of the original loan contracts as proof that the loans are in fact mine. These loans do not show up on either of our credit reports so we are questioning where they came from. \\n\\nMy first phone call to Chase was on XX/XX/XXXX. I spoke to a woman named XXXX in the IRS notice department. She was \" unable to provide further information ''. Because Chase no longer directly deals with Student Loans, I could not get a direct number into Chase so I contacted our Local Chase bank branch and spoke to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She took my information and sent an internal email in an attempt to either get the information I was seeking or to put me in touch with the people who could. \\n\\nWhen I hadn't heard anything, I reached back out to XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. She was helping someone else so my call was taken by the branch manager, who took all of my information and filed a grievance on my behalf through Chase 's complaint and compliance department. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I was contacted by XXXX ( ID # XXXX ) with the complaint and compliance department. She said my information had been given to the research team who would look into the loans. When they completed their search, she would be back in touch with what they found. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX XXXX called me back and said they had located specifics on the loans in question and directed me to the Chase Recovery and loan specialist department, who would then be able to provide the appropriate documentation I was seeking. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I contacted the Loan Specialist department and spoke to a woman who confirmed the Loan numbers, amounts and cosigner. I asked why these loans were not showing up on any credit report and she stated that the loans \" drop off as soon as they are cancelled, '' a statement that is absolutely false. I requested copies of the original loan contracts and she said she would have them sent to me with no issue. The contract was post marked XX/XX/XXXX and arrived XX/XX/XXXX. However, the contract she sent was NOT the correct Loan contract. It was not the correct dates, amount or loan number.\\n\\nRealizing that I wasn't getting anywhere, my cosigner contacted Chase on XX/XX/XXXX attempting to get the information i requested. The man she spoke to again confirmed details but instead of sending contracts, referred her to the IRS for further questions. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my Cosigner again contacted Chase to directly request contract copies for these loans. On this phone call, she was told she was NOT a cosigner and therefore could not be given any information or sent any contracts. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, I contacted Chase again and spoke to loan specialist #  XXXX who confirmed that my cosigner was in fact on the loans. She said the original loans were taken out between XXXX. She said loans were charged off XX/XX/XXXX, letters sent in XXXX and reported cancelled in XXXX. This time she Could NOT confirm the address the 1099 's were sent to. She said she had no idea where the address came from ; she also corrected previous information given and confirmed that these loans should be on our credit reports ( she offered to send me to the credit reporting dept to \" fix '' the non reported loans ; I declined ). She said she had requested copies of the original contracts as well as copies of the 1099 's for these loans, to be sent to me in 7-10 business days. Unfortunately the only documentation she sent were 1099 's with the wrong address. I have STILL yet to receive a single piece of paper relating to these loan contracts.\\n\\nIt has been 2 months, numerous phones calls, and misinformation and I can not get any tangible proof that the loans reported cancelled on my name and social are in fact my loans and my responsibility. I once again called Chase on XX/XX/XXXX and asked to speak to a supervisor or someone in charge who could give me a definitive answer and send me concrete proof of these loans. I was transferred to a voicemail, left a very specific message with appropriate contact information, and I have yet to receive a phone call back as of XX/XX/XXXX, even though the voicemail greeting specifically states that a callback will take place within 24 business hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",

       "58   I made a purchase of {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I made payments of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The minimum payment was {$140.00}. The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase. Thank you in advance for your assistance. \\n\\nRespectfully, XXXX XXXX XXXX

       "213  My mortgage is with Chase. My payments were being made by XXXX XXXX XXXX paying early each month. XXXX was the provider of XXXX to Chase. Evidently, XXXX was sold to XXXX. On XX/XX/2019, XXXX transferred the files and told XXXX that Chase said I was bankrupt and to terminate the processes. XXXX did and did not pay Chase any longer. I have received no communication from anyone on this. I was going to open a checking account at Chase today and noticed that my mortgage had not been paid. I called and they said that XXXX will not pay them and have terminated me to bankruptcy, which I am not in since the mortgage holder would know. After much pain, I was able to get a mortgage verification letter sent to XXXX so they can restart my payments. However, I had to make a complete payment, pay late fees, and have now late payments that will be on my credit file and payment history. \\n\\nXXXX was negligent with the files transfer and XXXX was also negligent by not actually reading the date of the data and contacting the mortgage company to verify the sack of errant files that were delivered. \\n\\nWhat can be done? I have now marks on my credit report and had to pay fees for something that was done to me. No one will give me the records although they are about me and my finances. I thought that I am entitled to all records about myself. \\n\\nI am beyond upset and should have something done to remove the late payment recorded on me to the credit bureaus and filed to remove when a manual mortgage is run. XXXX must have been really evil and XXXX doesn't really read what they are given or even contact the person. XXXX did not let me know they were changing services. \\n\\nI can provide only the mortgage verification from Chase as the rest of the businesses refuse to provide written or electronic data. They say that they only the computers transferred the files and were processed. Evidently, XXXX did not use a human review process to read, only accept checked fields of bad records.

       "20   During the summer months, I experience a decline income due to my employment. Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''. I requested an explanation and representative stated a letter will be mailed with explanation. I have received XXXX letters the reason for denial was not \" policy changes ''. I would like CFPB help in exploring the denial of my payment extension request especially since I have been clear reason for denial.

       "82   I recently called to ask Chase bank why they reported to the credit Bureau that I was 30 days late on a payment that was already paid off. When I called I got this info : They showed that on the XXXX of XX/XX/2019 I was very late on my bill and owed XXXX to bring this balance down to XXXX and be finished with the bill. I paid that amount on the same day the XXXX to being it to XXXX. \\n\\nTHey say that I tried to make another payment for {$250.00} later that same day and in a few days that came back as a return payment. \\n\\nThe man on the phone stated to me that if the payment went through then it would have meant that I had a credit on my account for XXXX since I didnt owe anything. \\n\\nThey updated my account with charges and late fees from the return payment that I had no idea of since I thought I paid off the entire amount. They reported to the credit Bureau that I was 30 days late for not paying what accrued to be {$56.00} The guy representing Chase agreed with me that they were in the wrong for charging me the fees and said they would remove them. I still have {$2.00} in the negative that they are saying that i owe in the mobile app. \\n\\nAdditionally, because they reported me being late my credit score dropped 51 points. When I called back to ask if they can report that they made a mistake they said I would have to do that on my own. I think that's XXXX.

       "267  I received an offer from Chase XXXX Visa promising a companion airline pass XXXX bonus points for opening a Chase XXXX Visa card. I applied for the card online in XX/XX/XXXX providing my current email address, phone number and address. I was approved. In XXXX I requested paperless billing statements/correspondence and assumed that my current contact information provided at time of approval would be utilized by Chase for the XXXX XXXX. \\n\\nHaving previous Chase credit card products I was able to log into my online account and setup automatic bill payment for my account. I used my card as needed to earn the companion pass and bonus points and assumed the auto payments were being made from my checking account as I viewed line items that had Chase in the description and as I was not receiving paper statements/emails or phone calls from Chase regarding my XXXX account. \\n\\nIn reviewing my checking account statement in XXXX and realizing the that the Chase line item was actually an auto payment for one of my husbands credit cards and was not in fact for the XXXX Visa card I reached out to Chase XXXX Visa immediately. \\n\\nOn XX/XX/XXXX I reached out to the customer service phone number listed on the back of my card ( Payments are due on the XXXX of the month ) to learn that I was 34 days past due and explained that auto payment had been requested on my end via the online tool which they explained could take 1-2 business cycles but did not appear to have gone into affect. \\n\\nAdditionally, I learned that they did not have the correct contact information in the system but instead had reached out to old email addresses and telephone contact information from previous accounts that had auto populated instead of using the correct information I had provided at the time of application. \\n\\nI made a payment by phone immediately to payoff the entire balance, requested auto payment to be setup and confirmed on their end as well as requested that the current contact information be setup in the system to avoid missing communications in the future. \\n\\nThey made notation in the account of the challenge, reversed all late charges and ensured me that the late payment would not be reported to the credit bureau due to the banking error. Also confirmed that I had met the required spend to earn the bonus and given the banking error, reversal of late charges, payment in full and notation that I would be eligible to receive the companion pass and bonus points which I HAVE received. This reassured me that there would not be any negative credit reporting as it appeared that they had addressed the issue on their end. \\n\\nAll subsequent payments have been made on time and as of XX/XX/XXXX the account has a {$12.00} balance due to charges made after payment in full. \\n\\nIn XX/XX/XXXX I received an email from XXXX alert service that I subscribe to that my credit score had decreased from XXXX to XXXX. I opened the XXXX file which stated a late payment was reported by Chase for XXXX. I filed a dispute and in XXXX received an email from XXXX  stating the dispute had been resolved. Upon further investigation it noted that the negative reporting was not being removed. \\n\\nI contacted Chase XXXX Visa, explained the negative reporting, the agent reviewed the notes in the account and verified that they had made notation of the banking error due to the internet site not correctly setting up auto payment and the reversal of all late charges. They stated that the \" Credit Bureau Unit '' was not currently open and requested I call back the next day and request to speak to the unit as they would be able to to correct the information. \\n\\nI followed the advice and spoke with XXXX, CBU specialist in the XXXX, MO call center. After a long period of discussion XXXX informed me that there was nothing that he could do to update the file and remove the late payment reporting to the bureau. \\n\\nAfter requesting all notation on my file he advised I send a fax to the \" Business Office '' at ( XXXX ) XXXX but that there was not a live person to speak with nor an email that I could send the request to. \\n\\nI asked to speak to his supervisor at which point he transferred me away from his department to a supervisor in the customer service department without telling me that he was actually transferring me out of the credit bureau unit back to XXXX customer service. \\n\\nIn speaking with XXXX in customer service I believed that I was still speaking to the Credit Bureau department. I recalled all events, she confirmed the notation in the account. Additionally, I advised her that even after multiple attempts and confirmation that my current contact information had been updated that on XX/XX/XXXX my online account was still displaying old contact information as the default for all Chase accounts. I was able to uncover this while attempting to log into my account I received a screen that stated that I needed to enter a code to proceed and the phone numbers/email that were pre-populated by the website to receive the codes were outdated information. I had to call the phone number listed to receive the access code and that once I was able to gain access into the account I confirmed that that while my current contact information was listed the DEFAULT contact information that was highlighted on the top was actually old out dated information. \\n\\nI explained to her that when I tried to update the info on the site it would not allow me to delete the old info or update the current info to be set as the default for the account. She assisted with updating on her end, had me log out and log back in to confirm that the correct information was now showing on my end as the default contact information. \\n\\nGiven all of the challenges with the site that have been noted extensively as well as the notation of the banking challenge due to the malfunction of the auto payment setup I asked if she would be able to assist with removing the negative reporting. At this point SHE ADVISED ME THAT I HAD BEEN TRANSFERRED OUT OF THE CREDIT BUREAU DEPARTMENT and that she would attempt to connect with a credit bureau specialist to see what could be done. I explained that I had already spoken with XXXX in that department and that I was hoping to speak with his supervisor when he had transferred me to her. She stated that the supervisors in that department can take up to 5 days to provide a call back. \\n\\nShe then got another credit bureau specialist on the phone named XXXX, explained the situation and XXXX told her that there \" was nothing that he could do to assist ''. \\n\\nI have never been late with a payment across all accounts. I have spent numerous hours trying to resolve this matter with JP Morgan Chase/XXXX. As a result of Chase/XXXX XXXX it appears that my diligence to setup auto payment & provide current contact information for my account were not feasible and will now have a significant impact on the cost of credit that I will be seeking for a new home purchase mortgage given that my credit rating went from \" Outstanding '' to \" Good '' and is the main tool used by lenders for determining interest rates offered. \\n\\nI am reaching out to you in hopes that you will be able to 1 ) Assist with restoring my credit due to banking/IT error on the part of the credit card issuer 2 ) By sharing my story prevent another person from being lured into getting a credit card from Chase and have to deal with the same challenges I have faced.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",
       "78   My Dispute is for not receiving services listed below : -- One Night at the Hotel in XXXX {$730.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\n-- Transportation to the Hotel {$170.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\n-- Private City Tour of XXXX {$220.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\n-- XXXX XXXX Private Tour {$150.00} for Friday XX/XX/2018. \\nGrand Total of {$1200.00} Reason for not receiving the services was that XXXX cancelled the flight from XXXX to XXXX for mechanical reasons. \\nI started the process for the of the refund thru XXXX XXXX, I was told by XXXX XXXX that I needed to request the refund thru XXXX, which I did, I requested the refund and was told by XXXX that since i didn't purchase the ticket directly thru them but it was done thru a 3rd party I needed to go thru XXXX XXXX, I went back to them and was told that they will not refund me. \\nI then started a dispute with my credit card Chase Visa for the charges, the Credit Card Dispute Department closed my dispute saying that the vendor stated that I did receive the services which is not true but my Credit card closed the dispute after several attempts by me to reopen the dispute.

       "88   I pre-ordered an item on XX/XX/XXXX and paid {$350.00} with a Chase credit card. The merchant, XXXX XXXX, gave an estimated product shipment date of \" XX/XX/XXXX. '' After waiting for this item for a significant amount of time, I decided to cancel the order as it did not appear that the item would ever be completed and shipped. On XX/XX/XXXX, I requested a refund from the merchant, XXXX XXXX On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant stated that my order was cancelled, and the refund would return to the original method of payment in five business days. The original method of payment was a Chase credit card that I had since closed. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent a secure message to Chase requesting that the refund be transferred to one of my open Chase cards. I also followed up with a phone call that same week, and the representative I spoke to informed me that funds that are sent to closed accounts would be sent via check through the mail and could not be transferred to any existing accounts. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase indicating that my \" disputed charge '' would remain on my account and \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account. '' I followed up with a phone call to Chase describing that this was a refund, not a dispute. The representative informed me that they did not have access to closed accounts. I explained my previous attempts via phone and message to locate these funds. They informed me to try to send a secure message again this time emphasizing that the refund I am looking for is on a closed account and that the previous representative may have looked for the refund on a different account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent another secure message with this information as well as the emails I received from the merchant about the refund ( see Attachment ).  On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Chase with similar language about \" the merchant is not willing to credit your account '' and \" we consider the charge valid based on the results of our research '' ( see Attachment ). On XX/XX/XXXX, I followed up with the merchant, XXXX XXXX, requesting an alternate way to receive this refund given that my credit card company apparently can not locate the funds. On XX/XX/XXXX, the merchant provided a screenshot with their records that the funds had been refunded ( see Attachment ). This was my last exchange trying to resolve this between the credit card or the merchant.

       "63   I tried to send almost {$2000.00} at XXXX and the transaction was cancelled due to having no ID. I was charged but never received the service. I was supposed to receive a refund back to my card but it never happened. My account has since been closed and I'm out of almost {$2000.00}.

       "45   I made a purchase with XXXX XXXX XXXX on XX/XX/2019 in the amount of {$38.00}. I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.

       "129  This complaint is a follow up regarding a complaint # XXXX filed on cfpb. \\n\\nThe original complaint was regarding a dispute detailed below. \\n\\nMy laptop was stolen last year and someone used my information to book two flights from two different cities headed to the same destination. I immediately disputed the transactions as soon as i got a notification.i filed the complaint within an hour of getting notification that flights have been booked on my credit card. chase was extremely slow to respond and didnt do due diligence and contact the airline right away to cancel the flight and get me a refund. \\nChase did a very poor job at investigating the incident and put the charges back on my credit card without doing a proper investigation. when i asked, i was told that i benefited from the transactions. Clearly, i couldnt have flown from two different cities to the same destination. later, the airline also confirmed that i never took benefited from those flights. chase asked me for a bunch of documents and i provided all the documents including the police report for the stolen laptop, proof that the flights were booked under my name. however, the date of births used to book the flights were not mine. Clearly, i couldnt have benefited from the services even if i wanted to. \\nThe way chase handled the dispute was extremely poor and after multiple bad experiences and inability of chase to resolve disputes, i am pretty positive that chase is horrible at resolving disputes. \\nI am over that but this complaint i am filing is NOT about the original claim.Please read below about this complaint. \\n\\nPLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY! \\n\\nAfter this incident, i contacted XXXX and inquired about the flight. They told me that they found too bookings for the same person headed to the same destination from two destinations and cancelled one of the bookings and issued a refund. Chase has NOT contacted XXXX ONCE to resolve this issue. XXXX has confirmed several times that they have issued me a refund and the money has been transferred to my bank account. However, chase hasnt issued me a refund. Whenever i contact chase, they give me same old response. the case has been closed. I am not opening the same claim. Its a new complaint. XXXX has issued me a refund and it hasnt been given to me by chase. XXXX 's customer service can not connect me to the accounting team and therefore it not possible for me to find the transaction and details.This is chase banks job! connect with them and find out whats going on. Instead chase is asking me to contact XXXX and prove that the refund has been issued. XXXX is telling me to have my bank contact their accounting department because its a banks job to resolve this issues.Now, i am filing a new complaint demanding my money with interest and all the time chase has wasted. \\nI am attaching the documents that XXXX has provided me. Chase has asked me to provide these documents. Its chase 's job but i am doing this ob their behalf. \\n\\nXXXX is clearly stating that the bank has the funds. They have also provided me a document showing that transaction details that the refund was applied to my account. \\n\\nPlease issue me a refund. I have done everything i could have. Please, DO NOT close my complaint without issuing me a refund that XXXX has issued a long time ago! \\nEnough is enough!

       "138  On XX/XX/2019, I submitted a complaint to my bank JP Morgan Chase due to a charge of {$410.00} from my debit card which was lost and the bank did not cancel in time. On said date I disputed the charge and asked to issue a new card. The venue which the card was charged was a strip club called XXXX XXXX based in XXXX, WA. The bank credited my account for the sum but on XX/XX/2019 withdrew those funds and gave them to the club in which I never have been. I submitted a fraud dispute with the bank at the time and today XX/XX/2019 found out that the bank Chase debited my account to the venue in which the fraud dispute was made. I tried to call the bank twice to discuss and was issued a new debit card as well but the charge stayed. \\n\\nIn my dispute and complaint is the bank is committing fraud on my account by siding with said merchant in which is a strip club and known for fraud activity on cards.

       "32   My chase amazon card was declined for a catering order I had placed for my brothers funeral in the amount of {$710.00}. I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did

       "160  On more than one occasion my bank ( Chase ) has charged me multiple overdraft fees towards my account. And it has to do with the way they process charges as they hit my account. They will take the largest item first, which will overdraw my account, and then charge smaller items afterwards. Back on XX/XX/XXXX, this very same thing happened. We had a balance of {$130.00} and I had 3 charges come in to my accountone for {$350.00}, one for {$69.00} and another for {$46.00}. The bank ran all of these in that order and subsequently charged me 3 overdraft fees in the amount of {$34.00} each. When I called to complain about this practice they said they do it that way because they feel that larger items are more important items like house payments, car payments, etc. The bank has reimbursed us before for this practice, but told me this is a one-time courtesy and will not do it again. \\nHad those charges been done in reverse order, we would have had only one charge. In my opinion, as well as the rep from your agency, this is a shady business practice and a way for a bank to make more money off of people struggling to make it through until payday!! \\nAnd this continues to happen to this day

       "11  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",

I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018.

       "11  On XX/XX/2018, while trying to book a XXXX  XXXX  ticket, I came across an offer for {$300.00} to be applied towards the ticket if I applied for a rewards card. I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.   \n",
